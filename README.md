# tinge_of_magic
Web app template with only a little magic.

## what is this?
This is a bare bones webpack template that I use for my projects. Occasionally people ask me about my setup, so I put this together so that it's easier for me to start new projects and easier for others to learn my process. My process works for me, it might work for you, it likely will not work for most people.

Nope, but I wish you luck on your journey.

### Isn't that last question passive aggressive? You said be kind...
Who's asking these questions?
